The project here is a Java project that was initially
created for the Java Basic programming project at KUL advanced Masters program.
First the project was run on Eclipse in Windows laptop.
Then this project was also run on Ubuntu platform using
Java software on Ubuntu.

Here I list the softwares I installed on Ubuntu to run the Java project.


1. sudo apt-get install vim-gtk3

Installing Java..
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
before using eclipse ide we need to install java
we can install either JRE or JDK

JRE comes with minimal tools to create java applications. JDK is full fledged toolkit which have everything which is required to create a java applications.

Next there are two flavors of Java - open source or oracle

*Also there is NO need to install Oracle JDK (Actually OpenJDK is much better than Oracle one for me).

 If you do it without -y, you will see that webupd8team recommend using java 8 as version 9 has issues.
XXXXXX Thus dont try sudo apt install openjdk-9-jre. XXXXXXX

 I installed java 8 using this method today & it worked fine (but I don't know how to solve your problem for java 9) â€“ Zanna Apr 29 at 16:16

Use this command to install version 8 of open jdk
sudo apt-get install openjdk-8*

Installing Eclipse
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Firstly I downloaded eclipse-inst-linux64.tar.gz 
to a location, say ~/softwares.

I untarred the above tarball.
Then I used the installer program in the untarred directory
to start the Eclipse installation process.

Also see a picture to see how the installation process looks - eclipseInstallPhoto.png
